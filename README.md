# Hi, I'm Sijie Fu (付思杰) 👋

I am currently a Ph.D. student in the [Department of Chemistry](https://www.cmu.edu/chemistry/) at Carnegie Mellon University, with a Ph.D. minor in Machine Learning. I work in the [Washburn Group](https://groups.chem.cmu.edu/washburn/), where I am advised by Prof. [Newell Washburn](https://www.cmu.edu/chemistry/people/faculty/washburn.html). Prior to joining CMU, I received my B.E. in Materials Science and Engineering from [Peking University](https://pku.edu.cn/), where I worked with Prof. [Qiang Sun](https://www.mse.pku.edu.cn/info/1216/1246.htm).

I see myself as a computational chemist specializing in leveraging machine learning and AI for chemistry-related problems. Want to know more about me? Check out my [personal page](https://sijiefu.github.io/) or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fusijie).
